* What and why
  
  After something like 30 years (possibly dating back configs on TECO
  based TOPS20 emacs) I am declaring [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy][dot emacs bankrupcy]] and sarting
  over.   Too much cruft has accreted.   I'm sure there are things in
  my config that I've just assumed were defaults for decades (like the
  "C-x p" I just typed to try to fill this paragraph).  

  One of the precipitating events was org2blog breaking....I'm
  assuming it was some bad interaction with old cruft in my config.

* Inspirations

  - org mode :: http://orgmode.org/ Org mode has caused me to view the
                world through text colored glasses.  What started out
                as a deceptivly simple outliner is now my document
                authoring system, my code execution environment, my
                spredsheet, time tracker, planner, etc....

  - Sacha Chua :: Sacha Chua is putting on an awesome series of 
                  interviews and [[http://sachachua.com/blog/emacs-chat/][emacs chats]] that create community among the
                  isolated and dispersed culture of emacs geeks.
  - Xah Lee :: [[https://plus.google.com/+XahLee/posts][Xah Lee]] posts an incessent stream of useful ideas, many
               drawn from his excellent [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html][Xah Emacs Tutorial]].  You can
               [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/buy_xah_emacs_tutorial.html][buy the Xah Emacs Tutorial]] to support his fine
               semi-gratis work.   And if you ever wanted to learn
               about the ergonomics of keyboards and key bindings, you
               will never find someone with a deeper knowledge
               http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html or more studied
               application http://ergoemacs.org/

* Goals
  The goals for my .eamcsrc (well, .emacs.d/init.el) rewwrite are:
  - Legibility
  - Modularity
  - Managability
  - Understandability
  - Extensibility

* Approach
** General Approach
  - Start from scratch
  - Add one thing at a time from old configs, elsewhere, verify that
    it's working
  - Move to the next
** Specific Approach*
** DONE Borrow a framework for loading emacs init from .org that works
    - Sacha Chua's basic framework
      + minor config in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
      + loads ~/.emacs.d/george.org
*** TODO Load packages in a sane, modern way
    - use-package?
*** TODO Decide on a framework for commenting config sections
    - See existing .org blocks
    - Should cover what, why, how, when
    - Code section
    - echo "Loading FOO done" to *Messages* for debugging
*** TODO Decide on framework for modularity
    - One section per file ?
    - Some sort of #INCLUDE or all in one file?
    - enable/diable
      + based on context/system/network location?

* Things to add back
** TODO package.el and use-package loading packages
** TODO Keybinding from eons past
** TODO Autocompletion stuff
   - current ido stuff borrowed from xah or possibly whatever sacha is using
** TODO GNUS for email
** TODO org2Blog  
** TODO trello
** TODO dired hacks
** TODO latex export of PDFs
** TODO ffap
* New things to try
** TODO Yasnippit
* Things I've tried that I need to understand better
** TODO Org clock-in, clock-out
   - How do I manually edit timestamps?
** TODO Org tabels
   - Need to make peace with the arcane formla syntax
* Things I've tried before that I mgiht revist
** Agenda mode
